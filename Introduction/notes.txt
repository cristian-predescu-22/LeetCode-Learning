Time complexity is easy.

Space complexity is the allocated memory. for example veirables that are used to store values from the algorithm

Recursion calls itself however when it returns, it makes sure each return statemnt doesn't get out of the whoel main function, it goes back on itself.

It's like a snake eaitng itself. The snake begguins to eat itself more and more. Howevr when it wants to get out it has to backtrack step by step backwars
Each function will go back to the value it was called

Fibunaci sequance with recursion is like a tree
you keep going left until you get to the bottom then start going up and maybe sometimes to the right and you keep adding the values
Once you reach the top with the left side (with the number added up), do the same for the right side
After add both of them up and you get the final vallue you want to return
